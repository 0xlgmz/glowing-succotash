# 0xlgmz

Cloud / Platform Engineer. Builder. Reverse engineer. Automation addict.

I started my career on the help desk, fixing broken laptops and resetting passwords.  
Over time, I moved through enterprise engineering, DevOps, and into cloud/platform engineering.

Today I design and operate infrastructure at scale — Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD pipelines, platform tooling, and the systems that make software delivery boring (the good kind of boring).

## What I Do

- Cloud & Platform Engineering
- Kubernetes & container orchestration
- CI/CD pipelines and developer enablement
- Infrastructure as Code
- Automation-first everything
- Reverse engineering systems to understand how they *really* work

I enjoy taking complex systems apart, understanding their internals, and rebuilding them cleaner and more intentional than before.

## How I Think

Calm on the outside.  
A brain running at 1000 threads internally.

I care about:

- Clean architecture
- Repeatability
- Observability
- Reducing cognitive load for developers
- Making platforms feel invisible but powerful

If something can be automated, it probably should be.

## Why "0xlgmz"

`0x` represents the low-level foundation — where systems actually begin.  
The rest is intentionally abstract. Like a hash. Like a compiled artifact.

Built through iteration. Refined over time.

## Outside of Work

I’ve always been in tech. It’s not just a job, it’s how I think.

I’m into Asian culture, craftsmanship mindset, and the idea of mastering fundamentals before scaling complexity.  
That philosophy influences how I approach engineering: precision, discipline, constant improvement.

## This Blog

This is where I document:

- Platform engineering patterns
- Kubernetes learnings
- Pipeline design decisions
- Reverse engineering insights
- Automation experiments
- Notes to my future self

If you’re building platforms, breaking systems to understand them, or trying to make engineering smoother at scale — you’ll probably feel at home here.
